### &nbsp;&nbsp; Assignment 10

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _**Due 3 hours before the start of your Week #11 lesson**_

- Create an composition in which the visuals respond to sound in some way

- Your sketch should continue indefinately without repeating

- If you like, you may modify assignment #9 as a start for this assignment

- The rest is up to you... express your creativity... But beware deductions for poor readability; remember to indent your code, include semi-colons at the end of lines, and 'beautify' your sketch before submission.

- You must submit your work on Github!
